# Trust Labs Interview Assessment

1. 1000 pages
2. Keyword "Covid-19" + "economy" (or something similar)

# Process (for better or for worse)
Lets look at go.py --> how to extract info from webpage
Maybe work with WAT extracts? Easy to write code to extract URLS from JSON File

# Problems
1. Need to install warcio.archiveiterator
   1. pip install warcio --> need to mess with env't variables, woohoo!
   2. Fixing my path has taken almost 40 minutes, might just have to work without it so I dont pass in anything blank, I hate python...
   3. 1 hour later the path is fixed but now it can't even find the module, this is turning out to be var bad, how can I search when I cant even access the data...
   4. Time to do this all *blind* because I have tried everything from changing env't variables to manually adding it in my code
